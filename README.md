Hey there, this is Anna,

I just started to code in python, java and web (html, php, css,...) and am eager to find interesting people and projects on this page, helping me to make progress and get some hands on experience.
At the moment I'm studying computer science B.Sc. at night and on weekends next to my fulltime-IT-job, so it's babysteps to get to my goal :)

Anyone interested in contacting me is welcome!
